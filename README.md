# Simon's Personal Site
This repository has the files and code that generate my personal website. I've forked Jake Tae's site because I think it's awesome - Thank you Jake Tae!

## Jake Tae's site

This repository contains contents hosted my personal website. While the actual posts themselves are located in the `_posts` directory, I write my posts as Jupyter notebooks in `_jupyter`, then use a formatter and converter script to save them as markdown files. 

Feel free to visit my blog [here](https://jaketae.github.io)!
