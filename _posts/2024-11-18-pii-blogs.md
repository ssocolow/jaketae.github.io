# My Princeton in Ishikawa (PII) and Japan-America Student Conference (JASC) Blogs
I wrote these blogs to fulfill the requirements of my fellowship funding (but they were fun to write, good for reflection, and are now nostalgic to look back on). My blogs from PII are definitely better than my JASC ones.
